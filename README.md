# Movie review journal

A DIY insert for Traveler's Notebook (regular size) to track movies.

Each page is 210x110 mm and the default build will make 2 pages side by side,
so you will get a PDF with each page of 210x220 mm.

## Build

Make sure to have LuaLaTeX, arara, and all packages used (see them in the
source) then just run


```
make
```
